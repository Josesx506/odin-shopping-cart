This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Learnings
- The project built upon the React Router Contacts project and exposed me to creating nested and dynamic routes
- Fetched product data from `https://dummyjson.com/`
- Utilized two context providers `Products` and `Cart` and associated custom hooks wrapped around the main app component.
- Context providers gave all components access to read and update data interactively at the expense of large page re-renders for component updates.
- Used only 2 useEffects to render cache on application load with cleanup functions
- Wrap major components like `nav` and `footer` within the app layout to prevent individual imports.
- Learnt to use NextJS `Error()` components to render custom error status codes and messages
- Implemented Pagination to limit volume of data rendered per page.
- Utilized functions from `Cart` context provider to render product quantities and update cart values interactively.
- Implemented all routes as **server components**, then imported client components to fetch data from custom hooks and client providers.
- Learnt to import google fonts from nextJS as variables and use them across multiple css files from `layout.js`
- Learnt to generate css variables like component index from jsx and make it accessible within css files for animation and design. (Check memory card project `<Win />` component too).
- Utilized LocalForage with indexDB backend for caching data on client and persisting updates following refresh
    > [!TODO]
    > Learn how to encrypt data in client cache for security purposes
- Used first react utility function to format currency values.
- Used grid areas for the first time to improve card arrangement across media queries.

> [!Important]
> Learn how dynamic sizing works for NextJS image component. Using fixed widths like this project is not optimal

 ### Roadblocks
 Struggled to implement an animated product carousel on the homepage with css and settled for an interactive one with buttons for the user to select products.
